                                <h3>High School Life<small>   Posted on January 3, 2016</small></h3>
                                <p>I am currently still a high schooler and I hate it! It is very different compared to middle school. It is more work, more stress and you have no social life. My freshman year was not that bad, but sophomore year is when it hit me. It got much harder because of my classes and all the work load. My sophomore year, I did volunteer a lot and I did many different clubs. The two clubs I did last year were Viking Volunteers and BioMed which were clubs in my school. In my current year, which is junior year, I am not really doing any clubs because I am focusing on school. Most of my classes are a lot of work. Junior Year is the hardest year! There is SAT, lots of studying, AP testing and a lot of workload. I cannot wait to become a senior and graduate. Being a senior their is definitely less amount of stress compared to being a junior. Only thing to worry about is college apps.</p>
