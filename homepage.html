                            <p>Hello! My Name is Roshini E. I am a Junior and go to school in New Jersey. This is a great way to get to know me, so come explore my site!</p>
                            
                            <h4>My accomplishments</h4>
                            
                            <p>Over the past couple of years, I have accomplished many things. First, I volunnteered at a hospital and helped many people. I help my dad run an organization where I earned a numerous amount of hours and received an award. Also, this is year, I made an About Me website and a Trivia Game using JavaScript and Bootstrap in my Web Design Class. Lastly, I donated food and clothes to the needy.</p>
                            
                            <h4>My Goals</h4>
                            
                            <p>Over the next couple of years, I wish to accomplish more. After high school, I want to go to a really good college, (have not decided yet) with a major in Business and a minor in Computer Science. Also, when I am older, I want to run my own busines(I know thats a lot!) but I think I can handle it! I want to go to all-around trip to Europe, learn another new language, and buy my parents a nice house when I am older and working.</p>
                            
                            <h4>My Hobbies</h4>
                            
                            <p>When it comes to hobbies, I have a lot! I absoutely love to bake and cook. In my free time, I always bake and try new recipes out all the time. I like to hangout with my friends, dance, and spend time with my family. When I am with my family, we usually go out for a movie, have family game night, cook, or just relax! Also, even though I may not look like a sports person, I like to play Volleyball and Soccer.</p>

                            <p class = "list-group-item-paragraph">Over the summer, I took so time and helped out at the hospital. I volunteered from 4-8 Wednesday-Friday and it was for a good cause. I helped out the nurses, worked at the front and ran errands for everyone. It paid off, because it earned me a lot of hours.</p>

                            <p class = "list-group-item-paragraph">When I was in middle school, there was a baking competition. So I signed up for it just to check it out. I baked a red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. I ended up landing in 3rd place and got a prize for that! That was a fun experience!</p>

                            <p class = "list-group-item-paragraph">My family and another family created our own organization that helps the needy. Basically, we raise money by holding events like walk-a-thons, blood drives, bake sales and etc. After that, we either donate that money or we buy things for them.</p>
